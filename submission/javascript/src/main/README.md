## Summary
> Summarize your implementation, including key challenges you encountered

My implementation comprises `<number>` software components, totaling `<number>` lines of code. Key challenges included `<1, 2, 3 + how you solved them>`.

## Correctness & Performance Characterization
> Describe how you characterized the correctness and performance of your implementation

*Correctness*: I wrote `<number>` tests; these tests take `<time>` to execute. 

*Performance*: Evaluating RPC performance using [high-resolution timers](https://nodejs.org/api/perf_hooks.html) by sending 1000 service requests in a tght loop results in an average throughput of `<rps>` requests per second and an average latency of `<time>` ms.

## Key Feature
> How would you explain your implementation of `createRPC` to your grandparents (assuming your grandparents are not computer scientists...), i.e., with the minimum jargon possible?

## Time to Complete
> Roughly, how many hours did this milestone take you to complete?

Hours: `<time>`
